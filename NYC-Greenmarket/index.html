      <p>Carrots, radishes, and beets are here. Moments later, apples arrive across the square along the pears. Bread and honey take over the center, while the herbs and plants announce their arrival with their characteristic scents. The farmers finish their last details and we are set to start a new day at one of the 50 farmers markets in New York City.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I was sailing in the Patagonian fjords patrolling the Chilean sea, and now I’m worrying about the late frost that killed blooming fruits upstate.</p>

<p>For 10 years, I worked in the Chilean Navy as part of the Coast Guard. Growing weary of the ocean, and admittedly too seasick, I left my job to seek new opportunities. When I arrived in New York City, I immersed myself in my newly adopted community. I missed connecting with diverse groups like locals, scientists, seamen, and fishermen in my Navy days. Becoming a volunteer at the Greenmarket Program for GrowNYC was the perfect solution.</p>

<p>On my first day as a volunteer, I got a taste for what it takes to organize a farmers market. I saw many vendors selling all sorts of products; big trucks parked in the open space; and of course all the customers shopping at the market. This market wasn’t any different from what I saw in the ferias of my home country, but within the first few minutes of my training, my Market Manager explained to me the things I didn’t see.</p>

<div class="caption">Preparing for a new day at the farmers market</div>

<p>All the vendors sell only local, seasonal, and fresh products, and they drive in from no more than 3 hours away. “So the apple vendor is a farmer?” I asked her and before I knew it, that same farmer gave me a free class on the life cycle of the apples they picked the day before.</p>

<p>Everything I heard that day was so new to me. I really didn’t know this before, and honestly, hadn’t thought too much about talking with these vendors nor asking them about the origin of my food. But I realized in that moment how much I could learn from these people.</p>

<p>More surprises were waiting for me that day when I realized I would be in charge of the popular cooking demonstrations at the market. The idea is simple. Check what ingredients are available that day at your market, choose your recipe, and prepare it for your customers. Well, I had never cooked for more than myself when I was in the Chilean Navy. I was nervous about the challenge, but soon it became second nature—chopping and cooking vegetables, while navigating the questions of our curious customers. “Oh, what are you making today?”</p>

<p>Greenmarket’s mission is to promote regional agriculture and ensure that all New Yorkers have access to fresh and locally grown food, including low income communities. The local farmers market is one of the biggest contributors to that goal considering the everyday impact the markets have on their communities. As a native Spanish speaker, I was happy to make accessible this same information to the Spanish speaking communities of NYC as well. The happy faces of neighbors when they see their square, park, street or sidewalk transform into a unique gathering place between them and their local farmers is very rewarding.</p>

<p>It has been two years since I became a Market Manager at Greenmarket. The beginning was challenging. I still remember my first day at the 175th St. Greenmarket (uptown Manhattan). This market is one of the oldest (over 30 years old!) and is located right in the heart of Washington Heights. Just as my first day started, I was exposed to all the situations that are never supposed to happen. Calling 911 for a customer that had fainted; a filming shoot, parking proceedings by NYPD to name a few. At least the floor wasn’t moving like when I was at sea! But, I was not alone. Behind every Market Manager is a family of four Regional Coordinators, friendly staff, and volunteers ready to help and support you. Also, the majority of the team started just like you as a volunteer or Market Manager.</p>

<p>Every farmers market is unique because it is immersed in a community with a distinct identity. The biggest challenge is connecting that community with their local farmers, and it is right there where the Market Manager plays a key role. We help coordinate fun activities and information sessions like drawings, face painting, infographics, pictures, costumes, recipes, cooking demonstrations, contests, holiday celebrations, tours for kids and adults, and outreach.</p>

<p>Of course, the most important part of the market is undoubtedly the farmers. Greenmarket ensures that new Market Managers learn about the day-to-day of our farmers; during training week, we spend one day visiting and working in a farm upstate. Before, I never really questioned the process of how my food arrived at my plate and the importance of the people that participate in it. Now I’m constantly reminded of the important work of farmers, and understand much better the livelihood of some of my relatives living in the Chilean countryside.</p>

<p>I’ve learned a lot during the last two seasons working at the Greenmarket. Every conversation with the farmers, the community, the team, and the members of other programs at GrowNYC (recycling, gardening, and education) has inspired my new approach in life. I’ve incorporated what I’ve learned into my daily routines and my home. I built my first garden in my backyard. I added some new recipes to my repertoire. I finished my first worm compost bin, and made compost from the food scraps from my kitchen. Now whenever I travel to a new place, my trip wouldn’t be complete without visiting at least one local farmer’s market or farm.</p>

<p>It’s the end of the day here at the 175th St. Greenmarket. The farmers are loading up their trucks and are waiting for my signal to turn out the square. I wait for everybody to leave and look at the now empty space. Tomorrow another community will wake up to the colors and scents that local and fresh food provide.</p>
